1. DB connection changed to close properly (doQuerry): put close on finally at the end of try catch.
2. Fixed error import tables the 1st time when open 'database management' since it requires to left click to identify current level and current database. Now any click would identify those two.
3. Move get_parameter_tooltip from Read_Identifiers to Get_Parameter_Information to avoid read "strata_definition" file each time we need YT column's tooltip
4. Table Filter applied on all tables (when double left click) in main window and database management window 
5. Management overview now support viewing chart summary for multiple existing strata
6. Fixed showing MS abbreviation after adding split constraints
7. Change UI for NoParameter, NoIdentifier, CostParameter
8. fix Read Strata.
9. Add matchDataType for all 9 tables to get rid of the codes defining data type in "Reload after creating GUI"
10. modeled_strata column is changed to boolean check box and is editable
11. change ageclass "not found" --> null
12. Change code to trigger refreshing info of the model overview table 
13. readUserConstraints: change finding index to search column name to find index
14. Add id column, add FREE type, and add multiplier to user constraints table (the id is unique --> to prepare for flow constraints)
15. Move to the first added constraint after add new
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

16. Auto generate constraint unique id whenever a constraint or set of contraints are added
17. Free constraint is added into model as v(n)
18. multiplier is now activated when running model
19. Improve readDataBaseTables speed by getting rid of duplicated reads
20. User Constraints --> Basic Constraints
21. Add icon help for all panels. Move all icons to helpToolBar and put it to the top right of each panel.
22. Add rollover effect for 3 icons in the background window
23. Add Quick Edit for Basic Constraints window, this Quick Edit needs data to be update constantly after each New, New Set, or Delete Constraints.
24. General Inputs Layout --> GridBag
25. Advanced Constraints (flow only): arrangement, sources, tables, auto check before add new, reload, updateID, Quick Edit, Mouse Interaction Menu, etc...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

26. Show/Hied Logo feature
27. Change Font feature
28. Regain focus on the table when showing 2 Charts, change mouse listener to selection listener for showing the 2nd chart (Ctrl A works)
29. Change minimum size of MAIN in ComponentResizer to 600x35
30. Change the way writing parameters, static identifiers, dynamic identifiers to the basic constraints table (to prepare for constraint reload)
31. Change element_id --> attribute_id (input08 & strata_definition)
32. Change relaxed_perrcentage (Advanced Constraints) to 0-100%
33. Show/hide columns feature (Base Cost): 2 Preset selection choices: show default columns & show active columns. 
34. Disable columns that are not "per acre" to prevent users' mistakes (Base Cost & Parameters in Basic Constraints)
35. Trim all read_Identifiers --> read only once before reload GUI or add new strata_definition
36. Flow constraints are now active in the model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

37. Fix: now SpectrumLite can run without having any flow constraint set up
38. Re-arrange General Inputs
39. Change index of basic constraints (id, description, type, multiplier --> add bc_) and flow constraints (id, type --> add flow_) to avoid confusion
40. New output: flow_constraint with table and graph visualization
41. General Inputs: alow options of exporting original problem & solution files. Change solution to .sol extension
42. Flow: add new automatically set relaxed_percentage to 100%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

43. Add more details for the flow grapth description
44. Bug fixed (problem 2): due to a random function to pick EA table.
45. Change horizental resize in input4 and input7
46. Using Double.MIN_VALUE cause problem with flow upperbound_percentage constraint (Concert error incompatible bounds). Double.MAX_VALUE sounds to be unaffected. To make everything safe, 1 change was made for the whole modeling system: 1) Double.MIN_VALUE ---> - Double.MAX_VALUE
47. Set Font is now only available when all internal windows are closed
48. Bug fixed: read the correct annual discount rate (bug: read period instead of rate. This might happen during refactoring input01)
49. Currenly flow logic only support positive multipliers, the use of negative multipliers is prohibited.
50. introduce output06_basic_constraints
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

51. Allow to write solution without requiring any basic constraint set up
52. Multi-threads method is applied whenever start editting --> improve User experience with significant increase in reloading speed.
53. Move 3 output panel outside of Panel_Yield_Project
54. Introduce output5_management_details
55. Multi-threads method is apply for output5
56. Customize output is integrated into output5 (need more functionality)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

57. output5 is now having a much more faster Filter method applied
58. Move MS Fire method to above Even Age method
59. Deselect or select static identifiers will only work with visible checkboxes --> to prevent select or de-select invisible periods which slow the Table Filter
60 Users are allowed to set up min and max rotation age for both existing and regeneration strata
61. Allow capture images of GUI components (Ctrl + 1)
62. Clear 17 Bugs identified by FindBugs. The codes is now technically bug-free. The logic Bugs however may exist (Hopefully I am not that unlucky)
63. Database import has a security check to deny database that is not following SpectrumLite's data requirements
64. All existing strata that is not linked to Natural Growth table (-->not found starting ageclass) will not be selectable for modeled_strata. The codes change is located in the update_management_overview (table model overview)
65. Many shortcut keys have been applied
