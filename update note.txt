1. DB connection changed to close properly (doQuerry): put close on finally at the end of try catch.
2. Fixed error import tables the 1st time when open 'database management' since it requires to left click to identify current level and current database. Now any click would identify those two.
3. Move get_parameter_tooltip from Read_Identifiers to Get_Parameter_Information to avoid read "strata_definition" file each time we need YT column's tooltip
4. Table Filter applied on all tables (when double left click) in main window and database management window 
5. Management overview now support viewing chart summary for multiple existing strata
6. Fixed showing MS abbreviation after adding split constraints
7. Change UI for NoParameter, NoIdentifier, CostParameter
8. fix Read Strata.
9. Add matchDataType for all 9 tables to get rid of the codes defining data type in "Reload after creating GUI"
10. modeled_strata column is changed to boolean check box and is editable
11. change ageclass "not found" --> null
12. Change code to trigger refreshing info of the model overview table 
13. readUserConstraints: change finding index to search column name to find index
14. Add id column, add FREE type, and add multiplier to user constraints table (the id is unique --> to prepare for flow constraints)
15. Move to the first added constraint after add new
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

16. Auto generate constraint unique id whenever a constraint or set of contraints are added
17. Free constraint is added into model as v(n)
18. multiplier is now activated when running model
19. Improve readDataBaseTables speed by getting rid of duplicated reads
20. User Constraints --> Basic Constraints
21. Add icon help for all panels. Move all icons to helpToolBar and put it to the top right of each panel.
22. Add rollover effect for 3 icons in the background window
23. Add Quick Edit for Basic Constraints window, this Quick Edit needs data to be update constantly after each New, New Set, or Delete Constraints.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

26. Show/Hide Logo feature
27. Change Font feature
28. Regain focus on the table when showing 2 Charts, change mouse listener to selection listener for showing the 2nd chart (Ctrl A works)
29. Change minimum size of MAIN in ComponentResizer to 600x35
30. Change the way writing parameters, static identifiers, dynamic identifiers to the basic constraints table (to prepare for constraint reload)
31. Change element_id --> attribute_id (input08 & strata_definition)
32. Change relaxed_perrcentage (Advanced Constraints) to 0-100%
33. Show/hide columns feature (Base Cost): 2 Preset selection choices: show default columns & show active columns. 
34. Disable columns that are not "per acre" to prevent users' mistakes (Base Cost & Parameters in Basic Constraints)
35. Trim all read_Identifiers --> read only once before reload GUI or add new strata_definition
36. Flow constraints are now active in the model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

37. Fix: now SpectrumLite can run without having any flow constraint set up
38. Re-arrange General Inputs
39. Change index of basic constraints (id, description, type, multiplier --> add bc_) and flow constraints (id, type --> add flow_) to avoid confusion
40. New output: flow_constraint with table and graph visualization
41. General Inputs: alow options of exporting original problem & solution files. Change solution to .sol extension
42. Flow: add new automatically set relaxed_percentage to 100%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

43. Add more details for the flow grapth description
44. Bug fixed (problem 2): due to a random function to pick EA table.
45. Change horizental resize in input4 and input7
46. Using Double.MIN_VALUE cause problem with flow upperbound_percentage constraint (Concert error incompatible bounds). Double.MAX_VALUE sounds to be unaffected. To make everything safe, 1 change was made for the whole modeling system: 1) Double.MIN_VALUE ---> - Double.MAX_VALUE
47. Set Font is now only available when all internal windows are closed
48. Bug fixed: read the correct annual discount rate (bug: read period instead of rate. This might happen during refactoring input01)
49. Currenly flow logic only support positive multipliers, the use of negative multipliers is prohibited.
50. introduce output06_basic_constraints
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

51. Allow to write solution without requiring any basic constraint set up
52. Multi-threads method is applied whenever start editting --> improve User experience with significant increase in reloading speed.

57. output5 is now having a much more faster Filter method applied
58. Move MS Fire method to above Even Age method
59. Deselect or select static identifiers will only work with visible checkboxes --> to prevent select or de-select invisible periods which slow the Table Filter
60 Users are allowed to set up min and max rotation age for both existing and regeneration strata
61. Allow capture images of GUI components (Ctrl + 1)
62. Clear 17 Bugs identified by FindBugs. The codes is now technically bug-free. The logic Bugs however may exist (Hopefully I am not that unlucky)
63. Database import has a security check to deny database that is not following SpectrumLite's data requirements
64. All existing strata that is not linked to Natural Growth table (-->not found starting ageclass) will not be selectable for modeled_strata. The codes change is located in the update_management_overview (table model overview)
65. Many shortcut keys have been applied
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

66. Remove xEAe in the model logic since it is not necessary to have it. Changes include: remove xEAe in eq.10, eq.12a; remove the entire eq.11a; remove the entire eq.11c. And all variables are renamed.
67. Remove xEAe in the software codes, including:
- Changes and removals of the codes of the equations logic
- Change silviculture method to short names in Read_Indentifiers: Natural Growth --> NGe, Prescribed Burn -->PBe, Group Selection --> GSe, Even Age --> EAe
- Remove the conversion to detailed silviculture method names in ScrollPane_StaticIdentifiers & Panel_EditRun_Details & Output_Panel_Management_Details
- Change variable names in Panel_SolveRun (var definition & eq. 15 & Output_Panel_Management_Details): xNG --> xNGe; xPB --> xPBe; xGS --> xGSe; xEAe' --> xEAe; xMS --> xMSe; xEAr --> xNGr; xEAr' --> xEAr
- Changes in Get_Variable_Information: remove xEAe, change the "startwith" and "replace" with new var start names

- Split the if then of xEAe, xEAr, xNGr into 3 different if then
68. Move MSe to below EAe in the GUI of static identifiers
69. Fix method to get currentProjectFolder, previously based on active internal frame which is bad.
70. Fix error with multiple project lost icon buttons when edit runs of a project when other projects opened. This is due to JButton btnedit is defined as static and pass to the threads. static is removed.
71. change both logic and GUI: c -->s5R, t (in xEAe, xEAr) --> tR,
72. old formulation 12a is wrong? ex: tR,a,t only add 6,4,3 while we should add 6,4,3 and 6,5,3 (assume tR = 6 and t = 3) -->changed!
73. Print out the long variable value without using 2 digits after the dot (twoDform)
74. Change row ID search to the correct ones for XEAr and XNGr (both in codes and in formulation)
	- For xEAr: row to find = aR - 1 + t - tR
	- For xNGr: row to find = a - 1
75. For logic replacing bug: change eq. (12a): change loop tR from t + 1 (in xEAe and xEAr) to remove the period tR=t which has clear cut from calculating SR's area loss
76. Check all xEAe and xEAr condition from eq.10 to eq.15 (processing_age should be changed to rotation_age to make the codes more intuitive)
	- eq.10, eq.11b, eq.12a, eq.13: change processingAge to rotationAge: keep the calculation (actually no logic has been changed)
77. Solve the auto check "implementation" columns at some default rows, if the input03 exists and is successfully loaded 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

78. Change xEar: a-->aR in eq. 12a, 13
79. Change c-->s5r in eq.12a
80. Change c-->s5r and c'-->s5r' in eq.12b
81. Still keep c and c' in the codes because it is easier to read constraints (may need to change later)
82. Change database "strata" name to match name requirements in Part 2: SpectrumLite database: switch timing_choice and forest_status  
	- Get_Variable_Information & 
	- public void create_sample()
	- public String get_starting_ageclass
83. Hide PBr, GSr in the GUI, show them later after the future update of PBr and GSr in the model formulation
84. CNPZ fake actions created for all yield tables but very realistic.

86. Establish the link to correct EAe yield tables (too complicated, need to simplify somehow)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

87. Dynamic Identifiers duplicated calculation fixed
88. Adding Bark Beetle (BSe):

		- Add all terms needed for equations 10, 11b (change to 11), 12a, 13, 14d, and 15
		- Get_Variable_Information: add timing choice for EAe and EAr (after this, all EAe and EAr should be missing in the output, until database is updated with timing choice for Eae and Ear tables)
92. Remove choices from current sampleCNPZ and add 0 (as the only 1 choice) for the EAe and EAr data for testing

All changes in this block are associated with v27.jar, formulation22.docx, database4.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

93. Move existing_strata to database
	- Change class name: Read_database_Yield_Tables --> Read_Database

96. Move strata_definition to database
	- Change class name: Read_Indentifiers--> Read_Definition
	- Read_Definition: now read from strata_definition inside the database
	- FilesHandles: public static File chosenDefinition(): change strata_definition.csv to default_database.db and create that file to put into src 
	- Delete UI of "import definition", move some codes into "import database"
	- Panel_SolveRun: change file_StrataDefinition to file_Databse (so we can run), and remove the codes when set up problem to default definition
	- move the "import database" panel to "general inputs"
	- remove file_strata_definition (make it file_Database) 
	- a default_database.db is created to load properly
97. Disable database revert to save time. Model is always reset if a new database is imported (regarless of success or failure)
98. Merging Read_Database & Read_Definition + a lot of codes trim (still could not avoid conflict between reading from database & thread behavior)
99. default to selecting all exsiting strata (which have age class found) after import database.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

100. TableModelSpectrum: add method "update_model_overview" and also add one line to replace update overview codes in import database (general inputs). This help update overview whenever database is imported (overview is previously not updated after auto select existing strata)
101. button_import_database.addActionListener:  start another thread to make the software not frozen during database import.
102. Fix the thread: is_this_the_first_load = false; this would help not reloading the same database again and again whne press the green plus
103. Disable button when import database Thread starts, ReEnable when Thread ends

107. Fix to not change database when cancel database-browsing
108. Boost 2: only define variable that is associated with unempty prescription/yieldtable
	- Formulation:
		- MS: Remove 6b, make it the bound of variables so it would be no-problem if not defined (not affect boost 2)
		- BS: Remove 6d, make it the bound of variables so it would be no-problem if not defined (not affect boost 2)

	- Codes:
		- MS: Remove 6b, redefine variables bounds and add boost 2 conditions for variables, add boost 2 conditions for 6c and 15
		- BS: Remove 6d, redefine variables bounds and add boost 2 conditions for variables, add boost 2 conditions for 6e and 15

109. variables x[s1][s2][s3][s4][s5][s6][4] (also x[s1][s2][s3][s4][s5][s6][5]) would have the bounds set to 0 if no prescriptions for MS (also BS) exists. This make output04 pie chart so correctly

All changes in this block are associated with v29.jar, formulation24.docx, database4.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

110. Allow Flow chart (in output_07) resizable on right border
111. Important LinkedList is used to define layer: layer = (layer_id, layer_description, attributes) where attibutes is also a linked list (not use anywhere yet)
112. Change some uneditable columns in some tables (5, 6, 7, 8a) to darker colors; Align regeneration_percentage to the right
113. Bug 6 is fixed: set bounds to 0 for x(s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6,q) in eq. 7a, 8a, 9a, 10
114. Add Feature Auto Reload a basic constraint after left click released (This feature is a must for the design of Cost Adjustment GUI)
	- Reload dynamic identifiers (add 1 more column to the table: original_dynamic_identifiers, reload based on this column info)
	- Reload static identifiers
	- Reload Parameters
115. Edit button in Basic Constraints is now functional
116. Important Change: fix defining new list: for example, see ScrollPane_StaticIdentifiers where the 4 lists are defined. Need to change other places as well  --- Check Check later
117. Hide some columns in basic constraints and cost adjustment conditions, since it is always loaded to interface on click release
118. Add an options of submit/cancel for Edit button
119. Reload also work on key board selection by navigating
120. define all_layers all_layersToolTip, layers_Title, layers_Title_ToolTip only once after ReadDatabase
121. Remove Read_Databse (null) in some Panels to get rid of the "null" report - not actually error
122. output05_management_details is allowed to stop the Customize Mode GUI on click
123. Multi-threads are applied to improve Table Filter in output05. Need to review later.
124. Fixed reload based on table 10 (convert view to model) when writting reload for table 8, 9
125. Edit take effect immediately on click
126. age_class and action_type can now be placed any where in the yield tables (previously the col id must be 3 and last id respectively)
127. Change variable index in both GUI and formulation. Example: EAe --> EA_E, NGr --> NG_R, etc.
128. Rewrite the output05 filter: fix layer1 filter (make it false to have the same structure as other layers), and use more return to escape entry checking faster.
129. Change condition check for priting out total_penalty (currenly it does not print out total_penalty when upperbound = 0 which is wrong)
130. empty cell is now used for cost condition override
131. Remove drag on basic_table because it is simply annoying
132. Very important: Highlight layer 5 and 6 in red (Static identifier) since it is applied for existing strata only, regenerated strata do not use those 2 layers.
133. Very important: output05 filter (Static identifier): layer 5 and 6 are applied for existing strata only.
134. Management Cost GUI is built and and Logic is connected

All changes in this block are associated with v30.jar, formulation25.docx, database5.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

135. Some changes to match codes and formulation:
	- Eq 15: change rotation_age = 9999 which is wrong --> the right thing is: rotation_age = aR
	- Define variable: forgot to add underscore to PB_E variable --> fixed
	- Eq 15: change indexes for xEA_E and xEA_R variables to match formulation
	- private static Boolean are_all_static_identifiers_matched: only check identifiers vs layer5 and layer6 if forest_status is E and method is not MS or BS
	- Get_Variable_Information: add a "not available" whenever a search is implemented for each term --> this is a security in case of bad situation 
	- get_final_action_cost_list_and_conversion_cost_list_for_this_variable: add 2 if to make sure all null (or "") condition can be run:
		- if (this_condition_info[2].length() > 0) {
		- if (this_condition_info[3].length() > 0) {
	- reload_this_condition_action_cost_and_conversion_cost: add 2 if to make sure all null (or "") condition can be reloaded:
		- if(action_cost_info.length() > 0) {
		- if(conversion_cost_info.length() > 0) {
136. Popup added for Cost Conditons, Basic Constraints, and Advanced Constraints so users have a change to not modify if accidently hit the button
137. Allow: age_class (CGNF) or st_age_10 (CNPZ) to be searched as age, and hca_allsx (CNPZ) or rmcuft (CGNF) to show up as default in action cost
138. Change name for the panels in edit_details, add a new panel "Silviculture Method"
139. table_overview: add count strata and acres of the currently highlighted rows
140. Remove agelass from the extra layer permanently (now only method and period are used as 2 extra layers)
141. Redefine static_Identifiers scroll pane so it has more options of which layers to be added, also use it in Model Strata GUI (remove the previous long codes)
142. Refactor (Rename) a lot os tables, data, etc. THIS IS DANGEROUS! but necessary for the new input: silviculture_method
143. GUI completed for Silviculture Method Panel
144. Temporarily swith radioButton_Right (2 places at the start of edit_runs_details) to move Silvicultuer method after Model Strata
145. Boost 5:
	- Read_RunInputs: return unique model_strata_without_sizeclass_and_covertype, model_strata_without_sizeclass (this one is currently not used)
	- Except 12a, 13, 6a to 6e, and the definition of xEA_E: all the other definition and equations have the for loop rewritten
146. Fix the IF THEN that forgot to add for eq 15 regeneration variables

All changes in this block are associated with v31Boost5BufFixed.jar, formulation25.docx, database5.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

147. Some refactor in Panel_SolveRuns, Read_RunInputs, also fix some loops in Read_RunInputs (general_inputs & model_strata: remove the column header row before saving values)
148. Remove IF Then (for sstactic_identifiers) in eq.15 by using common_strata & common_trata_without_sizeclass_and_covertype (retailAll method)
149. SpectrumLite --> Prism : all names are replaced
150. Boost 1 completed (NG_E NG_R are default applied to every strata)
151. Hide the checkbox column in Silviculture Method (Could be deleted but still keep it incase if we need to use in the future)

All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.0.00.jar, Prism Formulation 01.docx, Prism Database 01.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

151. Boost 1: alow to interact with NG_E and NG_R in "Silviculture Method" window
152. Bug 9 fixed for equation 7a when an "if then" to remove constraint is unreachable.

All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.0.01.jar, Prism Formulation 01.docx, Prism Database 01.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

153. Add null check for sm_strata & sm_strata_without_sizeclass_and_covertype: This would allow all methods eligible to be applied if users do not have any row set up in "Silviculture Method" window.
154. Highlighted soft and hard constraints with colors
155. Remove currentPeriod in Panel_solveRuns, it is t --> no need to define
156. output05 now has the query works properly. Need more function nayway.

All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.0.03.jar, Prism Formulation 01.docx, Prism Database 01.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

157. QuickEdit_FlyConstraints is created.
158. Change all class and method to private in Output_Panel_Management_Details
159. Fly_Constraints can now be saved and reloaded (This output would be deleted any time you save after "Edit" or "Solve" the run)
160. Panel_yieldProject: in public void refreshProjectTree(): do not allow output_05_fly_constraints to appear in the GUI

All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.0.04.jar, Prism Formulation 01.docx, Prism Database 01.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

161. Boost 6:
	- Define var_name at the top to not have to define again
	- Remove int[][][][][][][] xNGe

	- Remove int[][][][][][][][][][] xEAe
	- Remove int[][][][][][][][] xMS
	- Remove int[][][][][][][][] xBS
	- Remove int[][][][][][][] xNGr
	- Remove int[][][][][][][] xPBr
	- Remove int[][][][][][][] xGSr
	- Remove int[][][][][][][][][][] xEAr
Save at 09/08/2017 - Retrieve later if need this boost but probably will never use this bad boost
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

162. Auto save is triggered right after run querries using the "play" button in output05
163. Output 05 querries are put into thread when "play" button is clicked. This is to avoid frozen screen
164. Close all running threads and call gabage collector to retrieve memory after mouse click on Poject Jtree. This is important since It helps get memory back from the thread running querries in output05 (this threads add up memory if not call system.gc()) Note: ithe call system.gc sometimes does not trigger the collection. Note 2: This thing slow down the system --> disable.
165. Print out more information during the solving process
166. Bug 10 fixed (BS and MS timing choice jumping)
	- 6c is now 6b, t-->1
	- 6e is now 6d, t-->1
	- Add 2 transitional equation 6c and 6d
