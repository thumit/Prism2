Uses Proposed Action Analysis Areas
15 time periods
NDEF on cubic volume
Ending inventory constraint on suited volume (per 15 >= average period (5-14)
Soft constraints for density
MSF from SYL calibration
B type sometimes converts to U
Only NG, MS, BS on MAG1
MAG 2,3,4,5,6 allow PB, GS
MAG 5,6 allow EA
Soft constraints for size goals
Put in some costs to test budget constraint
Set Discount Rate = 0 because the constraint level was discounted but the costs were not
Used 1.0.09 version of PRISM
Costs and budget from first draft of figures used. Real budget increased for first 5 decades then was non-binding
U was allowed to be planted across all MAGs
Added a burn constraint of 10,000 acres per year; included all prescriptions across all GAs, land allocations.
Turned on Percentage spending by WUI/Non-WUI constraint (flow)
Added Opening Constraints by MAG to max 30% of area based on decay functions, etc. described in design document
Increased price per CCF to $100 rather than $58 or $80 - a sensitivity analysis
Changed the penalty for DC goals in periods 6-15 to 0.5 rather than 1. 
    Emphasis should be on achieving DCs in the first 5 decades, but still give value to later periods in maintaining them when possible. 
    But, any trade-offs should go to earlier periods.
Added Lynx constraints - see Constraints.xlsx in the PRISM/CONSTRAINTS folder
NDEF constraint applied to only MAG 5 and 6

**New**
Volume in Period 1 weight changed from 0.5 to 0.05
