SYL13_20

August 2017 yield tables
MSF and SRF applied everywhere
NDEF on cubes total
NDEF with flex on both Custer and Gallatin side
Try limiting Rx Burns to see if it impacts the results or not.
No Harvest in Unsuited
Use the SYL suitability layer
Avg volume calculated for per. 10-19 
Adjust BS allocation to larger size classes
Add last period harvest constraint at least period 1 - per forest
Extend the constraints to period 20.
Max harvest Period 1
Expand Regen rotation ages
Don't use the PB constraint - it has a positive shadow price
Use Silviculture Method to control assigning things to layers - rather than a hard constraint no harvest in wilderness


*New
Use MSF numbers to reflect 2006-2015 MTBS data
Added msf range of 28,000 to 85,000 acres per decade
Updated SRF per veg type to better reflect the past data
Fixed the msf flow constraint to include all lands not just unsuited
removed: msf flow constraints tightened - 75-125 to try getting some in each period
