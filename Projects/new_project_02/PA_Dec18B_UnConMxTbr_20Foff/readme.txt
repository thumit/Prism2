* No GS in MAG2

PA_Dec14_C
* Revised saleprep/admin/NEPA for sawtimber to $1.24/CF based on late analysis that was corroborated by Mike Nicolucci personal comm. 12/24 and non-saw adjusted real calculations for 2014, 2015, 2016 per-sawlog ccf cost.

PA_Dec14_A
***Major changes:
       1. Updated DC size goals to better reflect Region 1 classification standards
